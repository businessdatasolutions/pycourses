## Prerequisites

:::{admonition} Before starting this module make sure you have:
:class: attention

- an installed [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) environment
- an IDE: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) account

## Purpose of this course

```{admonition} The general learning outcome of this course is:
The student is able to perform a well-defined task independently in a relatively clearly arranged situation, or is able to perform in a complex and unpredictable situation under supervision.
```

This course will provide you with an introduction to deep learning (DL) algorithms and their applications for intelligent systems and devices. The focus will be mainly on experimenting and testing with several DL systems in order to understand their basic functioning.

```{admonition} For a successful completion of the course, a student has:
:class: seealso
1. explored the concept of Artificial Intelligence and its relationships with all relevant related paradigms
2. experimented with various applications for AI (Vision, Audio, Language)
3. designed a demo or prototype for an AI application
```
